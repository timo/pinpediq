 pqt: PinpediQuest Tilemap
===========================

- first line:
   number of horitontal and vertical divisions in a tilemap: (comma seperated)
    _
   [1]     ttw = 1, tth = 1
    ___
   [1|2]   ttw = 2, tth = 2
   [3|4]
    _____
   [1|2|3] ttw = 3, tth = 2
   [4|5|6]

- following that:
   for each tile in the tilemap there is one collision information "square".
   this square contains the type of collision of that tile:

   0: air, non-colliding

   1: wall, fully colliding

   2: slope /    those two have the solid part at the bottom
   3: slope \

   4: slope /    those two have the solid part at the top
   5: slope \

   6: slope /    blocks only from above
   7: slope \    blocks only from above

   8: platform, blocks only from above. player can fall through
   9: platform, blocks only from above. player can't fall through

  10: shallow slope / left part      \
  11: shallow slope / right part     | those tiles have the solid part at the
  12: shallow slope \ left part      | bottom
  13: shallow slope \ right part     |
                                     |
  14: steep slope / lower part       |
  15: steep slope / upper part       |
  16: steep slope \ lower part       |
  17: steep slope \ upper part       /

  18: shallow slope / left part      \
  19: shallow slope / right part     | those tiles have the solid part at the
  20: shallow slope \ left part      | top
  21: shallow slope \ right part     |
                                     |
  22: steep slope / lower part       |
  23: steep slope / upper part       |
  24: steep slope \ lower part       |
  25: steep slope \ upper part       /

  26: shallow slope / left part      \
  27: shallow slope / right part     | those tiles have no solid part
  28: shallow slope \ left part      |
  29: shallow slope \ right part     |
                                     |
  30: steep slope / lower part       |
  31: steep slope / upper part       |
  32: steep slope \ lower part       |
  33: steep slope \ upper part       /

  34: wall, only left half blocking
  35: wall, only right half blocking
  36: wall, only upper half blocking
  37: wall, only lower half blocking

example: a 4*4 tileset
4, 4
0  1  1  1
0  0  2  3
1  1  4  5
10 11 12 13
