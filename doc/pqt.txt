 pqt: PinpediQuest Tilemap
===========================

- first line:
   number of horitontal and vertical divisions in a tilemap: (comma seperated)
    _
   [1]     ttw = 1, tth = 1
    ___
   [1|2]   ttw = 2, tth = 2
   [3|4]
    _____
   [1|2|3] ttw = 3, tth = 2
   [4|5|6]

- following that:
   for each tile in the tilemap there is one collision information "square".
   this square contains the type of collision of that tile:

   0: air, non-colliding

   1: wall, fully colliding

   2: slope /
   3: slope \

   4: platform, blocks only from above. player can fall through
   5: platform, blocks only from above. player can't fall through

   6: shallow slope / left part
   7: shallow slope / right part
   8: shallow slope \ left part
   9: shallow slope \ right part

  10: steep slope / lower part
  11: steep slope / upper part
  12: steep slope \ lower part
  13: steep slope \ upper part


example: a 4*4 tileset
4, 4
0  1  1  1
0  0  2  3
1  1  4  5
10 11 12 13
